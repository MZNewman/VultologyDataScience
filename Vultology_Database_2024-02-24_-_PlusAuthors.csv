Roger Penrose,Juan E. Sandoval,"Sir Roger Penrose is an eminent British mathematical physicist, recognized for his pioneering contributions to general relativity and cosmology. Born in 1931, Penrose's work has significantly deepened our understanding of the universe. Notably, he co-developed the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems in collaboration with Stephen Hawking. In 2020, he was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of general relativity. Penrose's creative ideas continue to influence the fields of mathematics, physics, and philosophy of mind.",https://cognitivetype.net/s/NiFe_Roger_Penrose_1.mp4,,,,publish,nife,ii--,directive,,,,,male,-1,western_europe,white/european,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
